# Massive Attack Clash DB Website
This repository contains the Go source code for a web app that serves a dynamically rendered website using Templ, TailwindCSS, and Go's standard HTTP tools.

### ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

Make sure you have following installed:
- **Go** - Dowload via your package manager or the [official Go Website](https://golang.google.cn/)
- **Templ** - Used for generating and rendering the HTML components 
 Install via:
 ```bash
 go install github.com/a-h/templ/cmd/templ@latest
 ```
- Project dependencies - Install with:
```bash
go mod tidy
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Missing these tools will result in compile-time errors

### ðŸ”¨ How to run
1. Generate Templ files (HTML to Go components):
```bash
templ generate
```

2. Run the project
 - To build and run seperately:
 ```bash
 go build .
 ./main.exe
 ```
 - Or to run in one step:
 ```bash
 go run .
 ```

> [!NOTE]
> You can switch between PostgreSQL and SQLite easily for development vs. production â€” just change the DB config.

> [!NOTE]
> Use gofmt (or gofumpt) for consistent formatting
